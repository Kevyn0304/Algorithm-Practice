# Algorithm-Practice
Practice programming different algorithms in various languages, starting with Python.

#h1 input.txt
- txt file with 100 random ints

#h1 runner.py
- creates and populates "input.txt"
- runs input file through each algorithm's method:
    - creates file with algorithm's name as it's file name
    - reads input file
    - prints sorted ints into created file
    - prints time taken (asymptotics)

#h1 output folder:
- where each sorting algorithm's file is stored
